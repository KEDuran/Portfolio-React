# Portfolio for Krystal E. Duran

This portfolio website was developed using React.js and updated on 8/9/2020. Please reference the content below for a detailed summary of the updates I included for this assignment. At this time, my portfolio website now has the following pages to showcase my work:

- About webpage - Provides a short personal bio with my contact information and links to all my professional sites
- Projects webpage - Showcases _two major projects_ and _four of my high scoring projects_
- Fun Facts webpage - Includes some fun facts about me
- Contact webpage - Includes a form that a user can fill out to contact me
  - At this time, the form submission functionality is still in development, so I included a modal to serve as an error message to warn the reader that this page is still in development after they click the submit button on this page.
