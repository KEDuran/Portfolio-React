# Portfolio for Krystal E. Duran

---

## Project Description

This portfolio website was developed using `React.js`. Please reference the content below for a detailed summary of the updates I included for this assignment. At this time, my portfolio website now has the following pages to showcase my work:

- About webpage - Provides a short personal bio with my contact information and links to all my professional sites
- Projects webpage - Showcases _two completed major projects_ and _four of my high scoring assignments_
- Fun Facts webpage - Includes some fun facts about me
- Contact webpage - Includes a form that a user can fill out to contact me
  - At this time, the form submission functionality is still in development, so I included a modal to serve as an error message to warn the reader that this page is still in development after they click the submit button on this page.

## My React.js Components

In this section, I briefly described all the components that I used when converting my repo into `React.js`.

- **NavbarComp Component** - This component serves as the re-generated navigation bar (i.e. header component) used throughout my portfolio.
- **Button Component** - This component serves as a re-useable button component used throughout my portfolio.
- **InputTextForm Component** - This component serves as a re-useable text input component that is used on the contact page in my portfolio.
- **InputTextArea Component** - Since I used Bootstrap for React.js to create these components, I created a separate text area component (in addition to the regular input text component) in order to use as the large text input componet on the contact page in my portfolio.
- **ProjectCard Component** - This component is the re-useable card component used to regenerate an individual card for each of the projects / assignments showcased in the projects page in my portfolio
- **FunFactsCard Component** - This component is the re-useable card component used to regenerate an individual card for each of the fun facts showcased in the fun facts page in my portfolio.
- **Footer Component** - This component serves as the re-generated footer used throughout my portfolio.
